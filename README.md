# newsletter-signup

I used the figma dev tools to help complete this, I will say it was rather nice, usually I eye ball it but, I have bad eyes lol.

I haven't coded in a while, I kinda gave up on it but doing this challenge made me excited again I'll code for fun and not stress about finding a job in this feild...
